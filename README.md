These classes are separated into different files
To access the class, create an instance of them in the Main method in the Program.cs file
Then you can run the various methods from there.

There are two classes:

Account - no private data/fields, use dot notation to access
AccountPrivate - private data/fields, use methods to access

If you want to see the objects and classes work with lists, copy and paste the code from the Lists-with-objects-and-class.cs file in the Program.cs file.


MyMath is an example of a static class..use the methods inside without instantiating anything.
